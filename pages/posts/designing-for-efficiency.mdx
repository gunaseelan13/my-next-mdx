"Why do customers buy a product? What makes them choose over a sea of alternatives?"

In 1950s, Abraham Maslow a renowned American philosopher discovered something we all knew but hard to put into words: no matter our age, gender, race or station of life, we all have basic need that must be met. Maslow illustrated this hierarchy in a pyramid and called it hierarchy of needs.

Functionality: Completing the intended task. The Very Basic. User should be able to complete his intended task without any issues. Flaw in this very basic thing would be a show stopper.
 
Efficiency: Completing the intended task with a very minimal effort possible. User should be more productive with minimum effort while using the product. He should realise the value he gets out.
 
Delight: Completing the intended task through a minimal effort and feeling of satisfaction/fulfilment/joy. User should have a feeling of fulfilment, joy while using the product.

Current affairs of Product Design
When faced with real world hard problems(complicated business decisions), we subconsciously substitute it with an easier problem(font, colours, shadow,style) and solve that instead.
 
“Grid, font, colour, and aesthetic style are irrelevant if [outcomes] haven’t been resolved first … [but] sometimes it’s just more fun to draw nice pictures and bury oneself in pixels than deal with complicated business decisions and people with different opinions.”
— Paul Adams, The dribbblisation of design
 
Product has to satisfy the needs in each level before moving on to the next. A product can’t be efficient if it isn’t functional. A product can’t be delightful if it isn’t efficient and functional.
 
When a product satisfies our need for functionality and efficiency, we remember the emotional impression (delight) we get while using them.
 

Measuring Efficiency
Tool time vs Goal time
Most modern products have functionality covered. But to increase efficiency we must look at things that brings down the efficiency at the first place.
 
Tool time is how much time wasted dealing with navigation and messiness of the actual product. Like how long it takes to open an add dialog and search for multiple person to add.
 
Goal time is writing an email/creating a presentation. More goal time investment, better the quality of result for user.Efficiency over here is not ideal. Focus should be on efficiency improvement relative to the goal time.
 
If you look deeper, tool time deficiency increases based on multiple factors. App response time, tech stack and other external factors but these can be solved with better code. But designing for better goal time is a harder problem to solve.

Knowing what your user want
Bloated/messy product is nothing but bunch of features that most users don’t need. When you add these small bunch of features together, someone needs everything.
 
Similarly when you add few large orgs you will end up with large bloated product, someone needs everything. For every feature there is a user. Some day a new fresh product might feel like they can disrupt large junk product with minimal features but then those messy features will look like gold mine in the long run.
 
There is no point in showing every feature to a normal user. When you scale up its hard for an average user to keep up with endless new feature.
 
"If it’s a really perfect product for you, it would just be bad for somebody else"

Increasing Efficiency
Efficiency in sake of reducing steps won’t help. Efficiency should be grown from customer values. Here are some places to improve efficiency…
 
Onboarding
If you want users to use our product then show them the core values not bunch of features. Everyone who is going to buy a product will have a goal in mind, it might be saving time, money, solve his user problem. Getting to know what user values at early stage is really important.
 
For Example, Pinterest asks its new user “What topics do you care about?”. This helped them to show best possible content.
